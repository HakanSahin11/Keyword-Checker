This applications purpose is to search for a specific word or character, caps or notand was devoloped in C#.
The application was primarily made for a specific site due to only been removing //a and //p nodes from the orignal html of the pase.
In this case i was using it for Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin (testing site) 
The design of it was rathr simple due to the short time, and that i mainly focus on the backend.
This was a rather small project in itself and was made within 5 workdays.
